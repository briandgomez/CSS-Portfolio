# Brian Gomez Portfolio

## Description
A portfolio is a very important tool for web developers since it allows them to demonstrate their skills to everyone. A portfolio for web developers can be seen as a profile and resume combined. It allows them to talk about themselves as well as the projects that they have worked on. Doing this allows developers to increase their chances of finding a job since it is available to the public. This specific profile was created using HTML and advanced CSS techniques such as media queries.
